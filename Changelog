    * Fix slow response time and excessive network requests for stations with
      with heavily cross-referenced related-station tags (most notable example:
      München Hbf)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.06 - Mon Feb 29 2016

    * Partially fix slow response time and excessive network requests for
      stations with heavily cross-referenced related-station tags (most notable
      example: München Hbf). The implementation is still slightly inefficient
      in these cases, but far better than before -- A complete fix will follow
      in the next release. Note that db-iris calls using
      -x/--exact/--no-related are not affected by this issue.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.05 - Sun Dec 20 2015

    * Update station list. It now uses data supplied by the Deutsche Bahn
      Open Data portal.
    * db-iris: New option -x / --exact / --no-related
    * IRIS->new: New options main_cache, realtime_cache and with_related
    * IRIS: Add ->station and ->related_stations accessors
    * db-iris: Include related stations in query output (for instance,
      "Köln Messe Deutz" will include "Köln Messe Deutz (tief)" and
      "Köln Messe Deutz Gl. 9-10"). Use --exact / --no-related to disable this.
    * IRIS: Same. Also, IRIS->new can now be passed Cache objects to cache
      HTTP requests for a user-defined time. This is most useful when
      building infoscreens and similar, since the scheduled and station data
      never changes and can therefore be cached to decrease network load and
      increase response time.

    * Result: Add qos code 79 ("Ohne Mehrzweckabteil")
    * db-iris: Accept UIC station codes

    * Station: Improve get_station matching quality by using the Levenshtein
      edit distance in addition to simple substring matching
    * new dependency: Text::LevenshteinXS (see README for notes about
      drop-in replacements)
    * new dependency: List::UtilsBy

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.02 - Tue May 26 2015

    * Added github repo to dist metadata and the doc

      trains (q96)
    * Result: Verify delay key 60 ("delays because of storm")
    * Result: Add qos key 70 ("no wifi" -- not entirely sure yet)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.01 - Fri May 15 2015

    * IRIS->new: Fix default lwp_options value (was documented, but not used)
    * Result->route_interesting: Also consider airports
    * Stations: Update DS100 code list. Fixes 9 stations in Köln, Düsseldorf
      and Wuppertal which had a wrong code/name combination assigned due to
      a parser error

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.00 - Fri May 01 2015

    * IRIS->new: Use lwp_options to explicitly pass arguments to the
      LWP::UserAgent constructor. Unknown arguments are now longer
      implicitly passed on

    * Result: Fix deep recursion error in TO_JSON

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.09 - Tue Apr 28 2015

    * Result: Add arrival_wings, departure_wings and is_wing accessors
      (a wing train is coupled to the respective departure, but has its own ID)
    * db-iris: Indicate wings in output
    * Result: Remove train_no_transfer accessor (was based on erroneous
      assumptions)
    * Result: Add is_unscheduled, replaced_by and replacement_for accessors
    * db-iris: Add -oR to show replacement information

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.08 - Thu Mar 12 2015

    * Clarify Result->train_id documentation
    * Add IRIS delay/qos keys 13, 60, 75, 76

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.07 - Fri Jan 09 2015

    * Fix a crash related to unscheduled additional stops in a train's route
    * Improve Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations matching
    * Add IRIS delay/qos keys 56, 59, 61, 65, 73, 74, 77

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.06 - Mon Nov 03 2014

    * New non-core module dependency: List::Compare
    * Add support for canceled and additional stops
    * db-iris: Add options -oa and -oc
    * Result: Add accessors additional_stops and canceled_stops
    * Improve support for delayed trains
    * Support additional IRIS delay messages

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.05 - Thu Oct 16 2014

    * Support additional IRIS delay messages

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.04 - Sat Jun 28 2014

    * Fix --track-via <stop> not matching trains changing their ID at <stop>
    * Add new (not entirely verified) IRIS delay and qos messages
    * IRIS: add serializable option. Use this if you intend to serialize
      the list returned by ->results
    * Do not errour out if only partial data is available, show partial data
      and a warning instead (closes #4)
    * Add several qos and delay messages

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.03 - Fri Feb 14 2014

    * IRIS / db-iris: Add lookahead option
    * db-iris: Fix --via not matching destination of trains with incomplete
      route data
    * Detect and merge duplicate results caused by train ID changes
    * Result: Provide realtime data in ->platform, add ->sched_platform
      accessor
    * db-iris: indicate platform changes with an exclamation mark

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.02 - Mon Feb 03 2014

    * Fix warnings when encountering unplanned (fchg-only) trains without
      arrival or departure platform
    * db-iris: add -V / --track-via option to display departure at start
      and expected arrival at a destination station
    * db-iris: Add -r / --realtime option to compute times using delay
      data
